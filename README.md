## üöÄ Overview

Rubber Duck is a fully autonomous sumo robot designed and built by three CEGEP students for the 2025 IEEE Sumo Bot Competition. Despite being the youngest team in the event, we engineered a robust, modular, and high-performance robot that combines advanced sensor fusion, real-time control, and professional-grade hardware and software practices.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Software Architecture

Our software is designed for **robustness, modularity, and maintainability**, using modern C++ and object-oriented principles. The main control logic is in `main.cpp`, which is organized as follows:

### Main Structure
- **All configuration constants** (pin assignments, sensor counts, PID gains, etc.) are defined at the top for easy tuning.
- **Subsystems are encapsulated in classes** for clarity and separation of concerns:
  - `I2CManager`: Handles I2C initialization, speed switching, bus scanning, and robust recovery (including SCL pulsing and STOP condition generation).
  - `DistanceSensorArray`: Manages all VL53L4CD sensors, including XSHUT pin control, address assignment, initialization, and reading. Handles timeouts and triggers I2C recovery if needed.
  - `ReflectanceSensorArray`: Manages QTR reflectance sensors, provides line/edge detection, and abstracts sensor reading.
  - `MotorDriver`: Wraps the VNH5019 motor shield, providing high-level speed and brake control.
  - `PIDController`: Implements a configurable PID loop for smooth, responsive tracking and alignment.
  - `IRStartModule`: Handles the IR start/stop module for competition compliance.
  - `TestMode` (abstract base class): Defines the interface for all test and operation modes.
  - **Test Mode Subclasses**: Each test mode (distance sensor test, reflectance test, motor test, I2C scanner, and full tracking mode) is implemented as a subclass of `TestMode`, encapsulating setup and loop logic for that mode.
  - `SumoBot`: The main orchestrator class. It owns all subsystems and test modes, manages mode selection, and delegates control to the current mode.

### Test Mode System
- The robot can be switched between multiple modes (distance sensor test, reflectance test, motor test, I2C scanner, and full tracking/competition mode) by changing a single variable.
- Each mode is self-contained, with its own setup and loop logic, making it easy to test and debug individual subsystems.
- The main Arduino `loop()` simply calls `sumoBot.update()`, which delegates to the current mode's loop.

### Error Handling & Diagnostics
- **I2C bus errors** are detected automatically (e.g., sensor timeouts) and trigger a robust recovery sequence.
- **Test modes** provide real-time feedback via serial output, including sensor readings, error states, and I2C device scanning.
- All classes are designed to fail gracefully and provide useful debug information.

### Modularity & Maintainability
- All hardware abstraction is encapsulated in classes, making it easy to swap out components or add new features.
- Constants and configuration are centralized for easy tuning.
- The code is thoroughly commented and organized for readability and future development.

### Example Main Loop (Simplified)
```cpp
void setup() {
  sumoBot.begin();
}
void loop() {
  sumoBot.update(); // Delegates to the selected mode's loop()
}
```
